    Given I log in as "ResourceInstructor01" user
    And I create an Add Test Quiz resource with:
      | name | MT_Quiz Template |
      | maxPoints | 90 |
    And I added a multiple choice question with:
      | question | What kind of animal is a feline |
      | choice_0 | Dog |
      | choice_1 | Elephant |
